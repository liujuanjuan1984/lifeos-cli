# CLI Guide

This document is a secondary overview of the current `lifeos` CLI.

Command-specific facts such as arguments, examples, constraints, and command notes must live in
`lifeos --help`, `lifeos <resource> --help`, and `lifeos <resource> <action> --help`.

Use this document for cross-command guidance only. Do not treat it as the source of truth for
resource-level command details.

## Command Grammar

The CLI follows one stable grammar:

```text
lifeos <resource> <action> [arguments] [options]
```

The public command tree prefers:

- short resource names
- short action verbs such as `add`, `list`, `show`, `update`, and `delete`
- `list` as the main query entrypoint for structured resources
- grouped namespaces such as `batch` for multi-record writes

## Documentation Model

To avoid duplicate maintenance, the documentation boundary is:

- Help is the primary command reference.
- Repository docs summarize cross-resource concepts and operating rules.
- When command behavior changes, update help first.
- Only update this file when a cross-command model, workflow, or policy changes.

Practical rule:

- If a user needs to know how to run one command correctly, that information belongs in help.

## Output Conventions

The current CLI output stays intentionally simple and scriptable.

- `list` commands print compact summary rows
- `show` commands print labeled fields
- `add` and `update` commands print short confirmation messages
- public `delete` commands report soft-delete results only

## Installation and Initialization

Install the published CLI:

```bash
uv tool install lifeos-cli
```

Initialize local configuration:

```bash
lifeos init
```

When no database URL is configured yet, `lifeos init` defaults to a local SQLite database file at
`~/.lifeos/lifeos.db`.

Inspect the effective runtime configuration:

```bash
lifeos config show
```

Check database connectivity and migrations:

```bash
lifeos db ping
lifeos db upgrade
```

## Runtime Preferences

The CLI persists a small set of runtime preferences:

- `timezone`
- `language`
- `day_starts_at`
- `week_starts_on`
- `vision_experience_rate_per_hour`

Time-oriented behavior follows these rules:

- `event` and `timelog` datetimes are stored in UTC-normalized form
- CLI timestamp rendering uses the configured `timezone`
- date-based queries also use the configured `day_starts_at`
- weekly habit summaries use the configured `week_starts_on`

## Command Families

The current command tree is organized around a few stable families:

- planning resources such as `area`, `vision`, `task`, `note`, `people`, and `tag`
- scheduling and tracking resources such as `event`, `schedule`, `timelog`, `habit`, and `habit-action`
- system and portability commands such as `init`, `config`, `db`, and `data`

Use `lifeos <resource> --help` to enter one family and then follow the resource-level help into the
action or namespace you need.

## Safety Model

The public CLI is intentionally conservative.

- public `delete` commands only soft-delete records
- public `batch delete` commands also only soft-delete records
- hard delete stays outside the public CLI

This boundary should remain stable as more resources are added.

## Agent Guidance

If the caller is an agent or another automation layer:

- start from `list` to discover identifiers
- use `show` before destructive or state-changing operations
- treat help as the only authoritative command-level reference
- run `lifeos config show` before writing human-authored payload fields
- use `Preference language` as the payload language for titles, descriptions, and note content unless the human explicitly asks for another language
- keep flows identifier-driven after discovery
- decide whether the record belongs to the human, the agent, or both before writing data
- prefer resource help and action help over repository docs whenever an operation depends on exact
  flags, scope rules, or examples
